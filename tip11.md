![tip11_1](images/tip11_1.png)

## d2w/W
>delete two words

## 2dw/W
>delete a word two times

## dw.
>delete a word and then repeat

# Take care:
![tip11_2](images/tip11_2.png)
>`d2w/W` and `2dw/W` are identical.`u`: the two words that were deleted will appear again. `.`: delete the next two words.

>`dw.`: `u`: `uu` or `2u` to restore the two words that were deleted. `.`: delete the next one word.

So, `d7w` == `dw......`
