**Expression Register**: allows us to perform calculations and then insert the result directly into our document.  
>`expression register` is addressed by the `=` symbol. From Insert mode we can access it by typing `<C-r>=`: opens a prompt at the bottom of the screen where we can type the expression that we want to evaluate. When done, we hit `<CR>`, and Vim inserts the result at our current position in the document.
