# Tip58: Snap Between Files Using Global Marks

**A global mark is a kind of bookmark that allows us to jump between files.**

**after set a mark** we can snap our cursor back to it with the `{letter} command.**

**By default, global marks are persisted between editing sessions**

## m{letter}
> to set a mark.

**Set a Global Mark Before Going Code Diving**
## :vimgrep /fooBar/
>to find all occurrences of a method called fooBar() in our codebase.

By default, :vimgrep jumps directly to the first match that it finds, which could mean switching to another file.
At this point, we can use the `<C-o>` command to get back to where we were prior to running :vimgrep.

Try to get into a habit of setting a global mark before using any commands that :
>interact with the quickfix list, such as `:grep`, `:vimgrep`, `:make`
>interact with the buffer and argument lists, such as `:args {arglist}`, `:argdo`

Note: set a blobal mark any time you see something that you might want to snap back to later.
