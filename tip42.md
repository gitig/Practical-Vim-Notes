# Tip42: Open a File by Its Filename Using `:find`

## :find
>open a file by its name without having to provide a fully qualified path.

**Configure the 'path'**
>'path' option allows us to specify a set of directories inside of which Vim will search when `:find` command is invoked.

## :set path+=app/**
>`**`: matches all subdirectories beneath the app/ directory.

**Use `:find` to Look up Files by Name**

## :find Main.js&lt;Tab&gt;
>after first Tab, vim expands the entire path of the first full match.
>after second Tab, vim expands the next matching full filepath.
