# Tip70: Evaluate an Iterator to Number Items in a List

**Rudimentary Vim Script**  
## :let i=0  
>create a variable called i and assign it a value of 0.  
  
## :echo i  
>allows us to inspect the current value assigned to a variable.  
  
## &lt;C-r&gt;=i&lt;CR&gt;  
>insert the value stored in variable.
