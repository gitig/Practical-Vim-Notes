#Tip14: Get Back to Normal Mode

##Insert Normal Mode  
>INM is a special version of Normal mode, which gives us one bullet. We can fire off a single command, after which we'll be returned to Insert mode immediately.  
  
##Example  
>`<C-o>zz`: When the current line is right at the top or button of the window, you sometimes want to scroll the screen to see a bit more context. The `zz` command **redraws the screen with the current line in the middle of the window**, which allows us to read **half a screen above and below** the line we're working on.
