# Tip39: Divide Your Workspace into Split Windows

In Vim's terminology, a window is a viewport onto a buffer.
We can open multiple windows, each containing the same buffer,
or we can load different buffers into each window.

## &lt;C-w&gt;s
>divide window horizontally, which create two windows of equal height.

## &lt;C-w&gt;v
>split window vertically, which produce two windows of equal width.

Note: you can repeat these commands as often as you like, splitting your workspace again and again in a process that resembles cell division.

Note: Each time we use the `<C-w>s` and `<C-w>v` commands, the two resulting split windows will **contain the same buffer** as the original window was divided.

## :edit
>load another buffer into the active window.

## &lt;C-w&gt;s :edit {filename}  === :split {filename}
>divide our workspace and then open another buffer in one split window while keeping the existing buffer visible in the other split.

In fact, `<C-w><C-w>` === `<C-w>w`, you can press the `<Ctrl>` key and hold it while typing `ww`(or `wj` or any others from the table) to change the active window. It's easier to do that.

## :close
>close the active window.

## :only
>close all windows except the active one.
