# Tip65: Normalize, Strike, Abort
Executing a macro can sometimes produce unexpected results, but we can achieve better consistency if we follow a handful of best practices.

When we execute a macro, Vim blindly repeats the sequence of canned keystrokes.

The golden rule is this: when recording a macro, ensure that every command is repeatable.

**Normalize the Cursor Position**
Before you do anything, make sure your cursor is positioned so that the next command does what you expect, where you expect it.

**Strike Your Target with a Repeatable Motion**
Word-wise motions, such as `w`, `b`, `e` and `ge` tend to be more flexible than character-wise `h` and `l` motions.
Don't forget: when recording a macro, using the mouse is **verboten**.

**Abort When a Motion Fails**
If a motion fails while a macro is executing, then Vim aborts the rest of the macro.

## number@a
>rather than executing `@a` ten times. We could prefix it with a count: `10@a`.
