# Tip6: Meet the Dot Formula  
  
## The Ideal: One Keystroke to Move, One Keystroke to Execute  
  
In all of these examples, using the dot command repeats the last change. But that’s not the only thing they share. A single keystroke is all that’s required to move the cursor to its next target. We’re using one keystroke to move and one keystroke to execute. It can’t really get any better than that, can it? It’s an ideal solution. We’ll see this editing strategy coming up again and again, so for the sake of convenience, we’ll refer to this pattern as the **Dot Formula**.
